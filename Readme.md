# I Hate messy downloads folder

# intro

This is a project that i created to be seted to run daily on some execution scheduler (I just had a mental breakdown opening my user download folders and seeing more than 5000 random shit in it);
it basicaly put every file from your downloads folder and put it into a semantic file that will be chosen by the file extension.

# how to run

for god sake just `dotnet run` this.

# I wish

- [] organize a workstation folder structure for work
- [] a study folder structure
- [] maybe open ai? from the file title and part of it content it can catalog where this file should go( would be interesting)
- [] produce an installer that executes himself without being regitered manually in a task scheduler.
